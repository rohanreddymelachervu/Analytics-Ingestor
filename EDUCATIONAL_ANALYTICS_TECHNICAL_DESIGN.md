# Educational Analytics Framework - Technical Design Document

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive design and implementation of a reporting framework for educational applications ecosystem, consisting of a Whiteboard App (teacher-facing) and Notebook App (student-facing) that synchronize during quiz sessions. The system is designed to handle data from approximately 1,000 schools, each with an average of 30 classrooms and 30 students per classroom (~900,000 students total).

---

## 1. Data Collection Strategy

### 1.1 Metrics Tracked Across Applications

#### Whiteboard App (Teacher Events)
The Whiteboard App captures teacher interactions and quiz management activities:

- **Quiz Session Management**
  - Session start/end timestamps with precise timing
  - Quiz metadata (title, description, subject classification)
  - Classroom association and participant enrollment
  - Real-time session status tracking

- **Question Publishing Events**
  - Question content and metadata
  - Publish timestamp with millisecond precision
  - Timer duration and countdown settings
  - Question difficulty classification
  - Expected answer format and validation rules

- **Real-time Control Events**
  - Question transitions and navigation
  - Timer modifications and extensions
  - Session pause/resume actions
  - Administrative interventions

#### Notebook App (Student Events)
The Notebook App captures student interactions and learning activities:

- **Answer Submission Events**
  - Student identification and answer content
  - Submission timestamp with response time calculation
  - Answer correctness validation
  - Confidence levels and self-assessment data

- **Engagement Events**
  - App focus/unfocus duration tracking
  - Question view time and attention patterns
  - Navigation patterns within the application
  - Session participation consistency

- **Performance Indicators**
  - Consecutive correct/incorrect answer streaks
  - Time-to-first-response patterns
  - Response consistency and reliability metrics
  - Learning progress indicators

### 1.2 Event-Based Tracking Methodology

The system employs a standardized event schema for consistent data collection:

```json
{
  "event_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "event_type": "answer_submitted",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:45.123Z",
  "session_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440001",
  "data": {
    "student_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440002",
    "question_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440003", 
    "answer": "B",
    "response_time_ms": 12300,
    "is_correct": true,
    "confidence_level": "high"
  }
}
```

**Event Processing Pipeline:**
1. **Collection**: Applications send events to `/api/events` endpoint via HTTPS
2. **Validation**: Event schema validation and JWT authentication
3. **Enrichment**: Add derived metrics (correctness calculation, timing analysis)
4. **Storage**: Persist to PostgreSQL with optimized indexing
5. **Processing**: Real-time and batch analytics processing
6. **Distribution**: Optional Kafka integration for real-time streaming

## 2. Database Schema Design

### 2.1 Complete Entity-Relationship Model

```sql
-- Core Educational Entities
CREATE TABLE quizzes (
  quiz_id      UUID      PRIMARY KEY,
  title        VARCHAR   NOT NULL,
  description  TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE classrooms (
  classroom_id  UUID    PRIMARY KEY,
  name          VARCHAR NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE students (
  student_id  UUID    PRIMARY KEY,
  name        VARCHAR
);

-- Relationship Tables
CREATE TABLE classroom_students (
  classroom_id  UUID NOT NULL,
  student_id    UUID NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (classroom_id, student_id),
  FOREIGN KEY (classroom_id) REFERENCES classrooms(classroom_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  FOREIGN KEY (student_id) REFERENCES students(student_id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

CREATE TABLE questions (
  question_id     UUID    PRIMARY KEY,
  quiz_id         UUID    NOT NULL,
  question_text   TEXT    NOT NULL,
  correct_answer  VARCHAR NOT NULL,
  FOREIGN KEY (quiz_id) REFERENCES quizzes(quiz_id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

-- Session Management
CREATE TABLE quiz_sessions (
  session_id     UUID      PRIMARY KEY,
  quiz_id        UUID      NOT NULL,
  classroom_id   UUID      NOT NULL,
  started_at     TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  ended_at       TIMESTAMP,
  FOREIGN KEY (quiz_id) REFERENCES quizzes(quiz_id) ON DELETE RESTRICT,
  FOREIGN KEY (classroom_id) REFERENCES classrooms(classroom_id) ON DELETE RESTRICT
);

-- Event Tables for Analytics
CREATE TABLE question_published_events (
  event_id           UUID      PRIMARY KEY,
  session_id         UUID      NOT NULL,
  question_id        UUID      NOT NULL,
  teacher_id         UUID,
  published_at       TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  timer_duration_sec INT       NOT NULL,
  FOREIGN KEY (session_id) REFERENCES quiz_sessions(session_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  FOREIGN KEY (question_id) REFERENCES questions(question_id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

CREATE TABLE answer_submitted_events (
  event_id     UUID      PRIMARY KEY,
  session_id   UUID      NOT NULL,
  question_id  UUID      NOT NULL,
  student_id   UUID      NOT NULL,
  answer       VARCHAR   NOT NULL,
  is_correct   BOOLEAN   NOT NULL,
  submitted_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  FOREIGN KEY (session_id) REFERENCES quiz_sessions(session_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  FOREIGN KEY (question_id) REFERENCES questions(question_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  FOREIGN KEY (student_id) REFERENCES students(student_id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

-- Authentication and Authorization
CREATE TABLE users (
  id           SERIAL      PRIMARY KEY,
  name         VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  email        VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  password     VARCHAR      NOT NULL,
  role         VARCHAR(20)  NOT NULL DEFAULT 'writer',
  created_at   TIMESTAMP    NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at   TIMESTAMP    NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### 2.2 Performance Optimization Indexes

```sql
-- Critical indexes for analytical queries
CREATE INDEX idx_ase_session_question ON answer_submitted_events (session_id, question_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_ase_session_student ON answer_submitted_events (session_id, student_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_ase_submitted_at ON answer_submitted_events (submitted_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_qpe_session_published_at ON question_published_events (session_id, published_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_sessions_classroom_time ON quiz_sessions (classroom_id, started_at);
```

### 2.3 Scalability Considerations

- **Partitioning Strategy**: Tables partitioned by date for historical data management
- **Archival Process**: Automated archival of sessions older than 2 years
- **Read Replicas**: Dedicated read replicas for reporting to prevent performance impact
- **Connection Pooling**: Optimized connection pooling for concurrent access

---

## 3. API Design

### 3.1 Authentication & Authorization

**JWT-Based Security Model:**
- **Role-based Access Control**: `writer` (applications) vs `reader` (analytics)
- **Scope-based Permissions**: `WRITE` (event ingestion) vs `READ` (report access)
- **Token Expiration**: 24-hour token validity with refresh mechanism

```bash
# Authentication Endpoints
POST /api/auth/signup    # User registration
POST /api/auth/login     # JWT token generation
```

### 3.2 Data Ingestion Endpoints
